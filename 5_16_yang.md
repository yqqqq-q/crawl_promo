# Work Completed This Week
https://github.com/yqqqq-q/crawl_promo.git

Scraped promocode.com and retailmenot.com

Extracted information and stored it in a local MongoDB database

Served the data using Flask

# Challenges / Takeaways
Gained familiarity with scraping websites of this type.

# Plan for Next Week
refine code: logger, comments, scrapped refine, handle clicking 

Look for effective APIs for popular promo codes or price comparison

Build a prototype backend for handling promo data

# Note
I have class projects, meetings, exams, and presentations to focus from next week until 6/6, so my productivity may be lower during that time.
